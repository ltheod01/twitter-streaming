Streaming Live Tweets and plotting live sentiment analysis
With this code, you are plotting a sentiment analysis live, meaning that the code keeps running until the user decides to stop it.

My first python project using sentiment analysis, which uses 2 files to run.

You need to run both files in 2 separate modules and store your twitter credentials in a 3rd module named user_credentials which you use to access twitter.
